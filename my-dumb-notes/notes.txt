rust makes a simple promise: if your program passes the compiler's checks, it is free of undefined behavior.

- dangling pointers
- double-frees
- null pointer dereferences

q: what is actually caught at compile-time
a: only what is described as undefined behavior

meant as a solution to issues c and c++ programmers typically struggle with

rust attempts to tame concurrency through another set of compile-time checks

- mutexes
- condition variables
- channels
- atomics
- etc??
